An artist friend once told me “People who don’t have close connections with people have close connections with objects.” While I don't consider myself a misanthrope, if I have had a misanthropic connection with an object, it has been with this 2012 15” MacBook Pro. Though I’m retiring it today, it is for this reason it deserves a eulogy.

"Matthew Weiden's Macbook Pro" has been with me since December of 2012, shortly after I joined SoundCloud. Since this time, it has become the conduit of nearly all my efforts, ideas, and, at times, frustrations and failures. I worked at it blearily into the night and, with a quiet whirr, it absorbed the second half of my twenties.

It's beat up. The clamshell is loose on the left-hand side and the bottom anodized aluminum worn smooth from sliding into position on my desk. Though since cleaned, one of its fans runs slow after getting plugged with dust. Its GPU falters unexpectedly and often, blackening the screen. Its keyboard is coated in a scratchy layer of dried caffeine-sweat.

It has been places. It traveled weightily in my backpack or briefcase through many cafes and bars in Berlin. It went to security and machine learning conferences in France, Iceland, and Poland. I trained models on it in California. At home in my flat, I often fell asleep on the couch and it slid from my chest to the floor.

It has seen things. A good chunk of SoundCloud’s anti-spam and anti-abuse systems were written on it. It is wired to a data center. It chatted with Google's APIs. It computed evidence of spammers from Russia and used computer-vision to prevent hate-speech. On two occasions, it executed commands--live--on SoundCloud's production rails console. The code developed on it has handled well over 60 billion web requests to date.

Like other computers, it is both infinite and just a brick. Shift left, shift right, write, read, erase, halt.
