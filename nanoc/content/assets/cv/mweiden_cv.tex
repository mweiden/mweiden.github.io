\section{\sc Professional Experience}
{\bf SoundCloud Ltd.} Berlin, Germany\\
\vspace*{-.1in}
\begin{list1}
\item[] {\em Content Identification Team: Engineering Manager} \hfill {\bf July 2016 - Present}\\
Leads the Content Identification Team in building audio fingerprinting systems and copyright services. Focuses on supporting engineers, making business metrics visible, product development flow, and project management.

\begin{itemize}
\item As a hiring manager, built up a team from one engineer to five
\item Holds weekly one-on-one meetings with reports and writes feedback focused on performance review and professional development
\item Led the implementation of Agile practices including Kanban, Grooming, WIP limits, and frequent retrospectives
\item Redesigned the team's KPIs to better monitor its impact on company-wide KPIs and cost
\item Developed a Jira integration used by 18 different teams at SoundCloud to monitor Lead Time, Cycle Time, bugs, cumulative flow, and code inventory
\item Developed a set of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_control}{simple visual controls} to help engineering managers improve their project management
\item Wrote a report with recommendations on optimizing product development flow that are being adopted company-wide; their adoption has correlated with a 30\% reduction of SoundCloud's code inventory and a reported 29\% reduction in the average lead time of its teams
\item Writes technical reports for legal, rightsholder management, and funding purposes
\item Manages contracts and integrations with Audible Magic, a third party contractor
\end{itemize}
