\begin{itemize}
\item Managing development of two projects: \href{https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene}{cellxgene}, a visualization tool for single-cell expression matrices, and Corpora, a data portal with harmonized datasets enabling \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0093-7}{integrative single-cell analysis}.
\end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf Engineering Manager \textbar ~Science Platforms Team} \hfill \textcolor{darkgray}{February 2018 - October 2019} \vspace{1mm} \\
The Science Platforms Team built software and fostered collaborations within the biomedical scientific community in order to develop high-scale, cloud-based compute platforms for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_analysis}{single-cell analysis} ecosystem.
\begin{itemize}
\item Managed CZI's software contributions to the \href{https://www.humancellatlas.org/data-coordination/}{Human Cell Atlas Data Coordination Platform} including its  \href{https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/fusillade}{authentication/authorization framework}, \href{https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/upload-service}{data upload API}, \href{https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/matrix-service}{expression matrix API}, and \href{https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp-monitoring}{observability framework}
\item Partnered with engineering teams at the University of California: Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, the European Bioinformatics Institute, the Cherry Lab at Stanford, and the Broad Institute of Harvard/MIT
\end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf Backend Engineer \textbar ~Science Tools and Platforms Team} \hfill \textcolor{darkgray}{November 2017 - January 2018} \vspace{1mm} \\
Joined the Science Tools and Platforms Team to work on technology contributions to the \href{https://www.humancellatlas.org/}{Human Cell Atlas}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Delivered the first iteration of a \href{https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/logs}{logging and monitoring system}
\end{itemize}
\end{list1}


{\bf SoundCloud Ltd.} \hfill \textcolor{darkgray}{Berlin, Germany}\\
\begin{list1}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\item[] {\bf Engineering Manager \textbar \, Content Identification Team} \hfill \textcolor{darkgray}{July 2016 - October 2017} \vspace{1mm} \\
The Content Identification Team built audio fingerprinting systems and copyright protection services to keep SoundCloud compliant with terms negotiated with Sony, Warner, and UMG.

\begin{itemize}
\item Hired four engineers, bringing total team size to five
\item Led the implementation of Agile practices including Kanban, Grooming, WIP limits, and frequent retrospectives
\item Redesigned the team's KPIs to better monitor its impact on company-wide KPIs and cost
\item Developed a \href{https://github.com/soundcloud/project-dev-kpis}{Jira integration} used by 18 different teams at SoundCloud to monitor Lead Time, Cycle Time, bugs, cumulative flow, and code inventory
\item Developed a \href{https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/deliver-software-faster-by-managing-work-in-progress-not-by-adding-overtime}{strategy to improve product development flow} that resulted in a 30\% reduction of SoundCloud's code inventory and a reported 29\% reduction in the average lead time of its teams
\item Wrote technical reports for legal, rightsholder management, and funding purposes
\item Managed contracts and integrations with Audible Magic, a third party contractor
\end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf Backend Engineer \textbar ~Trust, Safety, \& Security Team} \hfill \textcolor{darkgray}{November 2012 - June 2016} \vspace{1mm} \\
The Trust, Safety, and Security team provided SoundCloud's information security, anti-spam, and anti-abuse services.

\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented microservices and batch jobs for detecting spam, platform abuse, and terms of service violations
\item Trained machine learning models for detecting spam, designed/conducted experiments to validate model performance, and deployed models to production
\item Participated in risk-management exercises for estimating the company's risk liability
\item Redesigned the team's KPIs to monitor the impact of spam and abuse on company-wide KPIs and cost
\end{itemize}
